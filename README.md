## 🛠️ What I Build

- 🤖 **ML/Computer Vision**: YOLOv8, OpenCV, custom model training for object detection  
- 💬 **NLP & LLMs**: GPT-4, RAG architectures, BM25 retrieval systems
- 📊 **Data Engineering**: ETL pipelines, web scraping (Selenium), SQL databases (PostgreSQL)
- 🎯 **Full-Stack Apps**: Python (Flask, Streamlit), Docker, Git

**Core Stack**: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, YOLOv8, OpenCV, GPT-4, RAG, BM25, SQL, Streamlit, Docker

## 📂 Featured Projects

**🔍 GHS Safety Data Extraction System**  
End-to-end ML pipeline for automatic safety pictogram detection and data parsing. Trained custom YOLOv8 models (99%+ accuracy). Processed 3000+ products via automated scraping. Built Streamlit app for real-time extraction and GHS property calculation.

*Tech: YOLOv8, Python, Selenium, Computer Vision, Streamlit*

**💬 Internal AI Assistant Suite**  
Centralized dashboard powered by GPT-4 for internal resource retrieval. Hybrid search: SQLite-indexed RAG for documents + CSV-based contextual engine. Reduced manual search from minutes to seconds.

*Tech: Python, GPT-4, RAG, BM25, SQLite, Streamlit*
