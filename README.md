# 👋 Hi, I'm Mattia

🎨 **Research Chemist | Exploring Data Tools | Building Simple Things**

I'm a chemist based in Milan, Italy, currently working in product development and lab-scale formulation in the coatings industry. Over the past few years, I've been increasingly drawn to solving problems not just with chemistry, but with **code**, **dashboards**, and **internal tools** that make workflows more efficient and transparent.

## 🧪 What I do

- 🧴 Develop sustainable product formulations in R&D environments  
- ⚙️ Create internal tools using **PowerApps**, **Excel macros**, and **Python**  
- 📊 Analyze and visualize lab or personal data using **pandas**, **Streamlit**, and **SQL**  
- 🧠 Continuously learning about tech, automation, and data

## 🔧 Projects (more soon)

- 🧷 [GHS Pictogram Tracker](#) – A PowerApps tool to visualize chemical hazard labels (internal use)
- 💰 [Net Worth Dashboard](#) – Personal finance tracking tool built with PostgreSQL + Streamlit (WIP)
- ☕ [Coffee Roasting ROI Calculator](#) – Simple model to evaluate cost savings of home roasting
